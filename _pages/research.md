  <p>My investigation focuses on the genomic basis of biodiversity and is structured around three topics:</p>

  <div class="topic-box">
    <h3>1. The Genomic Mechanisms of Adaptation in Extreme Environments</h3>
    <p>A central question in evolutionary biology is how organisms adapt to survive in challenging environments. My research tackles this question by focusing on species that have colonized extreme habitats, such as the high-altitude plateaus of Asia or the perpetual darkness of subterranean caves. These settings act as natural laboratories for studying evolution in action, allowing us to explore the dynamic interplay between positive selection, which favors new, advantageous traits, and relaxed selection, which can lead to the degradation of traits that are no longer essential (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19500875/" target="_blank">Lahti et al., 2009</a>; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11127900/" target="_blank">Barton, 2000</a>).</p>
    <p>Using comparative genomic approaches, I scan the genomes of adapted populations to identify specific genes and molecular pathways that have been modified by natural selection. This approach allows me to pinpoint the genetic changes underlying key functional innovations, from metabolic adjustments in low-oxygen conditions to the remodeling of sensory systems in the absence of light. A deeper understanding of these adaptive mechanisms is crucial for predicting how vulnerable species may respond to future environmental pressures.</p>

    <h3>2. Evolutionary Genomics and the Architecture of Speciation</h3>
    <p>The origin of new species is often driven by more than just the slow accumulation of small-scale mutations. I am particularly interested in how large-scale structural changes to the genome can act as powerful catalysts for rapid diversification. My research investigates how events like chromosomal inversions and whole-genome duplications (polyploidy) fundamentally reshape the evolutionary trajectory of a lineage (Coyne & Orr, 2004; Soltis & Soltis, 2012).</p>
    <p>Chromosomal inversions, for example, can suppress recombination across vast genomic regions, effectively creating "supergenes" by locking together sets of co-adapted alleles and facilitating rapid divergence in traits like morphology and behavior (Kirkpatrick, 2010). In parallel, I explore how whole-genome duplication provides a complete second set of genes, a dramatic event that creates immediate genetic redundancy and opens novel evolutionary pathways for duplicated genes to acquire new functions (Ohno, 1970). By studying these powerful architectural drivers, my work seeks to understand their influence on the tempo and mode of evolution.</p>

    <h3>3. Integrative Systematics and Biodiversity Conservation</h3>
    <p>A significant fraction of global biodiversity remains undiscovered, often because it is concealed within "cryptic species" complexesâ€”groups of morphologically similar but genetically distinct lineages (Bickford et al., 2007). A core part of my research is dedicated to discovering and describing this hidden diversity using a multi-evidence approach that synthesizes data from different biological disciplines.</p>
    <p>This work often begins with broad-scale genetic surveys using tools like DNA barcoding, which provide a rapid and cost-effective method for identifying deeply divergent lineages and mapping biodiversity hotspots (Hebert et al., 2003). To rigorously test the species hypotheses that emerge, I then integrate genome-wide data with detailed analyses of morphology, bioacoustics, and ecological data. This approach not only provides robust evidence for species delimitation but also has direct conservation applications, helping to identify unique evolutionary units, refine their distribution maps, and guide critical management decisions for vulnerable populations and ecosystems worldwide (Frankham et al., 2002).</p>
