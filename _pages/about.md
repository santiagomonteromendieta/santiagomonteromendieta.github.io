Hi, I am Santiago (but you can call me Santi for short). I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="http://english.ioz.cas.cn/" target="_blank">Institute of Zoology</a> (IOZ) from the <a href="https://english.cas.cn" target="_blank">Chinese Academy of Sciences</a> (CAS). My current advisor is <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dxsg5HoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Baocheng Guo</a> from the <a href="https://guolaboratory.com/" target="_blank">Fish Evolution and Genomics Group</a> (FEGG).

**Research aim:** I seek to advance our understanding on the evolutionary mechanisms that produce and shape animal diversity on Earth through the study of genes and genomes. I am currently working on fish evolutionary genomics.  

**Research overview:** during the past few years, my work has mainly involved bioinformatics analyses of genomic datasets to answer evolutionary questions. My research has led to a number of discoveries, including insights into the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.14986" target="_blank">adaptation to high‐altitude habitats in honey bees</a>, the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2021.107167" target="_blank">diversification of Neotropical frogs in the Andes</a>, and the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0149985" target="_blank">high levels of cryptic diversity in the reptiles of the Socotra Archipelago</a>.

**Future plans:** I am happy to explore interesting evolutionary topics and to establish new collaborations with scientists around the world. If you need assistance with anything related to my [PUBLICATIONS](https://santiagomonteromendieta.github.io/publications/), I can help you.

  <summary><b>Bio (click to show)</b></summary>
  Born nearby the city of Barcelona in Spain. From a young age, one of my dreams was to become a scientist and make new discoveries that can help us to better understand our world. In 2009, I joined the University of Girona (Girona, Spain) to pursue a BSc in biology. At that time, I was interested in animal behavior, and in the last year of my bachelor I had the chance of carrying my undergraduate thesis at Linköping University (Linköping, Sweden). In 2013, I enrolled in the University of Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain) to complete a MSc in biodiversity with a major in evolutionary biology. During this time, I was lucky to do my master thesis at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (Barcelona, Spain), where I began gaining research experience. In 2015, I started a PhD at the Doñana Biological Station (Seville, Spain), which I successfully defended four years later. In my PhD thesis, I used genomic tools to study the adaptation and diversification of natural populations to high elevation. During the course of my doctorate, I also did several research stays at Uppsala University (Uppsala, Sweden). Currently, I am conducting research on phylogenomics and comparative genomics as part of my postdoc at the CAS Institute of Zoology (Beijing, China), where I got my very first research funds.
