Hi, my name is Santi. Welcome to my website. As a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="http://english.ioz.cas.cn/" target="_blank">Institute of Zoology</a> (IOZ, Beijing) under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dxsg5HoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Baocheng Guo</a> from the <a href="https://guolaboratory.com/" target="_blank">Fish Evolution and Genomics Group</a> (FEGG), my primary focus is to understand the evolutionary mechanisms that shape animal diversity on Earth through the study of genes and genomes.

**Research:** I am currently engaged in research on fish evolutionary genomics, using bioinformatics analyses of genomic datasets to uncover insights into evolutionary questions. Some of my notable findings include understanding the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.14986" target="_blank">adaptation to high‐altitude habitats in honey bees</a>, uncovering the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2021.107167" target="_blank">diversification patterns of Neotropical frogs in the Andes</a>, and revealing <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0149985" target="_blank">high levels of cryptic diversity in the reptiles of the Socotra Archipelago</a>.

**Contact:** I am always open to exploring interesting evolutionary topics and establishing new collaborations with researchers from around the world. Feel free to reach out to me to discuss potential collaborations or engage in scientific discussions at: biomendi-ioz-ac-cn.

  <summary><b>Brief bio (click to show)</b></summary>
  Born nearby the city of Barcelona in Spain. From a young age, one of my dreams was to become a scientist and make new discoveries that can help us to better understand our world. My passion for scientific discovery led me to pursue a BSc in Biology at the University of Girona. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a keen interest in animal behavior and had the opportunity to conduct my thesis at Linköping University in Sweden.
  
<br>

  I then pursued an MSc in Biodiversity with a major in evolutionary biology at the University of Barcelona. This period provided me with valuable research experience at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona. Subsequently, I embarked on a Ph.D. at the Doñana Biological Station in Seville, where I successfully defended my thesis. My doctoral research focused on using genomic tools to study the adaptation and diversification of natural populations in high elevation. During my Ph.D., I also undertook research stays at Uppsala University in Sweden.

  Currently, I am conducting research on phylogenomics and comparative genomics as part of my postdoctoral position at the CAS Institute of Zoology in Beijing, China.

**Funding:** I am proud to acknowledge that my research is currently funded by a prestigious PIFI fellowship from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and research funds for international young scientists provided by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). The support of these organizations allows me to pursue groundbreaking research in the field of evolutionary genomics.
