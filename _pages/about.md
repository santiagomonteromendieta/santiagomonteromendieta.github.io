I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. Advisor: [Baocheng Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dxsg5HoAAAAJ&hl=en).

**Research aim:** I seek to advance our understanding on the evolutionary mechanisms that produce and shape animal diversity on Earth through the study of genes and genomes. I am currently working on fish evolutionary genomics.  

**Research overview:** during the past few years, my work has mainly involved bioinformatics analyses of genomic datasets to answer evolutionary questions. My research has led to a number of discoveries, including insights into the adaptation to high‐altitude habitats in honey bees, the diversification of Neotropical frogs in the Andes﻿​, and the high levels of cryptic diversity in the reptiles of the Socotra Archipelago.

**Future plans:** I am happy to explore interesting evolutionary topics and to establish new collaborations with scientists around the world. If you need assistance with anything related to my PUBLICATIONS, I can help you. 

**A bit more about me:** Born in Barcelona, Spain. From a young age, one of my dreams was to become a scientist and make new discoveries that can help us to better understand our world. In 2009, I joined the University of Girona (Girona, Spain) to pursue a B.Sc. in biology. At that time I was interested in animal behavior, and in the last year of my bachelor I had the chance of carrying my undergraduate thesis at Linköping University (Linköping, Sweden). In 2013, I enrolled in the University of Barcelona (Barcelona, Spain) to complete a M.Sc. in biodiversity with a major in evolutionary biology. During this time, I was lucky to do my master thesis at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology (Barcelona, Spain), where I began gaining research experience. In 2015, I started a Ph.D. at the Doñana Biological Station (Seville, Spain), which I successfully defended four years later. In my Ph.D. thesis, I used genomic tools to study the adaptation and diversification of natural populations to high elevation. During the course of my doctorate, I also researched at Uppsala University (Uppsala, Sweden) for over one year. Currently, I am conducting research on phylogenomics and comparative genomics as part of my postdoc at the CAS Institute of Zoology (Beijing, China).
