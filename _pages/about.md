Hi, my name is Santi. Welcome to my website. As a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="http://english.ioz.cas.cn/" target="_blank">Institute of Zoology</a> (IOZ, Beijing) under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dxsg5HoAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Baocheng Guo</a> from the <a href="https://guolaboratory.com/" target="_blank">Fish Evolution and Genomics Group</a> (FEGG), my primary focus is to understand the evolutionary mechanisms that shape animal diversity on Earth through the study of genes and genomes.

**Research:** I am currently engaged in research on fish evolutionary genomics, using bioinformatics analyses of genomic datasets to uncover insights into evolutionary questions. Some of my notable findings include understanding the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.14986" target="_blank">adaptation to high‐altitude habitats in honey bees</a>, uncovering the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ympev.2021.107167" target="_blank">diversification patterns of Neotropical frogs in the Andes</a>, and revealing <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0149985" target="_blank">high levels of cryptic diversity in the reptiles of the Socotra Archipelago</a>.

**Brief Biography:** Ever since I was young, I have dreamt of becoming a scientist and making meaningful contributions that enhance our understanding of the world. This passion for scientific exploration led me to pursue a BSc in Biology at the <a href="https://www.udg.edu/en" target="_blank">University of Girona</a>. During my undergraduate studies, I developed a keen interest in animals and had the opportunity to conduct my thesis at <a href="https://liu.se/en" target="_blank">Linköping University</a> in Sweden. I then pursued a MSc in Biodiversity with a major in evolutionary biology at the <a href="https://web.ub.edu/en" target="_blank">University of Barcelona</a>. This period provided me with valuable research experience at the <a href="https://www.ibe.upf-csic.es" target="_blank">Institute of Evolutionary Biology</a> in Barcelona. Subsequently, I embarked on a PhD at the <a href="http://www.ebd.csic.es/en/inicio" target="_blank">Doñana Biological Station</a> in Seville, where I successfully defended my thesis. My doctoral research focused on using genomic tools to study the adaptation and diversification of natural populations in high elevation. During my PhD, I also undertook research stays at <a href="https://www.uu.se/en" target="_blank">Uppsala University</a> in Sweden. Currently, I am conducting research on phylogenomics and comparative genomics as part of my postdoctoral position at the CAS Institute of Zoology in Beijing, China.

**Funding:** I am proud to acknowledge that my research research is currently possible thanks to funds for international young scientists provided by the <a href="https://www.nsfc.gov.cn/english/site_1/index.html" target="_blank">National Natural Science Foundation of China</a> (NSFC). Previously, I was funded by a prestigious <a href="http://international-talent.cas.cn/front/pc.html#/bicsite/pifiIntroduce/pifi" target="_blank">PIFI fellowship</a> from the <a href="https://english.cas.cn" target="_blank">Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)</a>. The support of these organizations allows me to pursue groundbreaking research in the field of evolutionary genomics.
