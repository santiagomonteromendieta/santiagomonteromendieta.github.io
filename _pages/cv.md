Research experience
======
I have used both molecular lab-work and bioinformatics tools to carry out my studies. My experience includes a wide variety of skills, such as: 
* DNA extraction and PCR amplification
* Processing genomic data, assembly and annotation (trimmomatic, samtools, bwa, bowtie, trinity, GATK, BLAST, ...)
* Programming (UNIX, Perl, Python, R, AWK, ...)
* Phylogenetic reconstructions (RAxML, BEAST, ...)
* Population genomics (FST scans, population diversity, detecting selection, ...)

Reviewer expercience
======
I have reviewed scientific articles for the following journals:
* BMC Genomics
* Conservation Genetics
* G3: Genes,Genomes,Genetics
* PLOS ONE
