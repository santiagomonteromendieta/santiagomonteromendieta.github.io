<h2>Unlocking the Genomic Secrets of Non-Model Organisms</h2>
<p class="takeaway">
A practical, reproducible roadmap for building <span class="highlight">de novo transcriptomes</span> in species lacking genomic references.
</p>

<div class="tldr">
    <h5>TL;DR</h5>
    <p>
        Many organisms—especially those with very large genomes—remain poorly studied at the genomic level.
        This study presents an accessible, step-by-step pipeline for assembling and annotating transcriptomes
        without a reference genome, lowering the barrier for ecological and evolutionary research in non-model species.
    </p>
</div>

<p>
Despite rapid advances in DNA sequencing, many species with exceptionally large genomes remain genomically unexplored.
Sequencing data are now relatively easy to generate, but turning raw reads into biologically meaningful results
still requires substantial bioinformatic expertise. <a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3702" target="_blank">
In a study published in <i>PeerJ</i></a>, we address this gap by presenting a clear, step-by-step guide
to building <span class="highlight">de novo transcriptome assemblies</span>, using a Neotropical frog as a case study.
</p>

    <p class="img_caption">
        <i>Oreobates cruralis</i>, a direct-developing frog from the Amazonian region with a large genome,
        served as the focal species for testing the transcriptome assembly pipeline.

<h4>The Challenges: Giant Genomes and Missing Maps</h4>
<p class="section-lead">
Large genomes and the absence of reference sequences complicate genomic studies in many taxa.
</p>

<p>
Amphibians pose a particular challenge for genomic research because their genomes are often extremely large—frequently
several times the size of the human genome—making whole-genome sequencing impractical for many projects.
As an alternative, researchers often rely on transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), which targets only genes
expressed in specific tissues.
</p>

<p>
However, in species lacking genomic references, transcriptomes must be assembled <i>de novo</i>.
This process is computationally demanding and involves many analytical decisions,
which can be difficult to navigate without prior bioinformatic training.
</p>

<h4>A Roadmap for Researchers</h4>
<p class="section-lead">
A transparent and reproducible workflow can substantially lower the entry barrier to transcriptomics.
</p>

<p>
To address this challenge, we developed a practical pipeline that guides users through read pre-processing,
<i>de novo</i> assembly, and functional annotation of transcriptomic data.
Rather than introducing new algorithms, the pipeline emphasizes
<span class="highlight">transparency, reproducibility, and informed decision-making</span> at each step.
</p>

<p>
By combining widely used tools such as Trinity and BLAST into a coherent workflow,
the pipeline enables researchers to move from raw RNA-seq reads to biologically interpretable results.
It is designed specifically for studies of species lacking genomic references,
with the goal of making transcriptomics more accessible to ecologists and evolutionary biologists.

</div>

<h4>Insights from the Amazon</h4>
<p class="section-lead">
Applying the pipeline reveals biologically meaningful patterns in a tropical amphibian.
</p>

<p>
We applied this workflow to <i>Oreobates cruralis</i>, a direct-developing frog from the Amazonian region of
Bolivia and Peru. The resulting assembly comprised over 422,000 transcripts,
providing a broad representation of expressed genes across multiple tissues.
Functional annotation revealed a high proportion of transcripts associated with immune response
and defense-related processes.
</p>

<p>
Genes involved in antioxidant activity were detected not only in the skin—an important barrier tissue in amphibians—
but also in internal organs such as the liver and spleen.
While these patterns do not by themselves demonstrate adaptation,
they highlight candidate pathways that may be relevant for understanding how tropical amphibians
cope with pathogen-rich environments.
</p>

<blockquote>
Even a single well-annotated transcriptome can serve as a valuable starting point
for evolutionary and conservation research.
</blockquote>

<h4>An Open Resource for Conservation</h4>
<p class="section-lead">
Genomic accessibility is increasingly important as biodiversity declines.
</p>

<p>
By making this pipeline <a href="https://github.com/biomendi/TRANSCRIPTOME-ASSEMBLY-PIPELINE/wiki" target="_blank">
freely available</a>, we aim to facilitate transcriptomic studies across a wide range of taxa.
As demonstrated with <i>O. cruralis</i>, even a single transcriptome can function as a stepping stone
toward future work in ecology, evolution, and conservation.
</p>

<p>
This is particularly relevant at a time when many species are declining faster
than genomic resources can be generated for them.
