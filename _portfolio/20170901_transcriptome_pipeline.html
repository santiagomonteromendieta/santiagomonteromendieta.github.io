    <p>We are currently in the "genomics era", yet for many species with large genomes, their genetic code remains a closed book. At the same time, while sequencing data has become cheaper and easier to generate, the bioinformatic analysis required to make sense of it remains a big barrier for many ecologists. <a href="https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.3702" target="_blank">In a study published in <i>PeerJ</i></a>, we address these challenges by presenting a step-by-step guide to assembling transcriptomes from scratch, using a little-known Neotropical frog as our case study.</p>

        <p class="img_caption"><i>Oreobates cruralis</i>, a direct-developing frog from the Amazonian region, served as the model to test our genomic assembly pipeline.</p>

    <h4>The Challenges: Giant Genomes and Missing Maps</h4>
    <p>Organisms like amphibians present a unique problem for geneticists: their genomes are often enormous, frequently exceeding the size of the human genome by several times. Sequencing them entirely is often prohibitively expensive. To bypass these, researchers often use transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), which focuses only on the genes that are actively expressed.</p> 
    
    <p>However, this creates a new hurdle. Unlike model organisms (like mice or fruit flies), these species lack a "reference genome" to use as a map. Researchers must assemble the genetic puzzle pieces entirely from scratch (<i>de novo</i>)—a complex computational task that can be daunting for non-specialists.</p>

    <h4>A Roadmap for Researchers</h4>
    <p>To bridge this gap, we developed a comprehensive pipeline designed to guide researchers through the complex process of pre-processing, assembling, and annotating genetic data. By integrating readily available software like Trinity and BLAST, we created a streamlined workflow that turns raw sequencing data into a functional profile of an organism's biology. <span class="highlight">Our goal was to make genomics accessible, providing a clear path for ecologists and evolutionary biologists to study non-model species without needing to be bioinformatics experts.</span></p>

        <p class="img_caption">The workflow developed in this study. It covers everything from cleaning raw reads to functional annotation, making it easier to study organisms without a reference genome.</p>

    <h4>Insights from the Amazon</h4>
    <p>We applied this pipeline to <i>Oreobates cruralis</i>, a frog found in the Amazonian rainforests of Bolivia and Peru. The results offered a detailed look at the molecular machinery this species uses to survive in a pathogen-rich tropical environment. We identified over 422,000 putative genes, with a surprisingly high abundance of genes related to the immune system and defense mechanisms.</p>
    
    <p>Our analysis revealed a high number of antioxidant genes not just in the skin—where amphibians typically fight off infections—but also in internal organs like the liver and spleen. This suggests a systemic defense strategy, likely an evolutionary adaptation to the high humidity and intense microbial activity of the Amazon floor.</p>

    <h4>An Open Resource for Conservation</h4>
    <p>By making this pipeline <a href="https://github.com/biomendi/TRANSCRIPTOME-ASSEMBLY-PIPELINE/wiki" target="_blank">freely available</a>, we hope to accelerate discovery in biodiversity research. As we showed with <i>O. cruralis</i>, even a single transcriptome can provide a "stepping-stone" to understanding the evolution and adaptation of species that have long remained genomic mysteries.</p>
