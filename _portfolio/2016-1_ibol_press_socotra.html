    <p>A study led by researchers from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) finds that over 50% of the reptile species in the archipelago of Socotra could still be undiscovered.</p>

    <h4>Astonishing biodiversity</h4>
    <p>Located in the north-west Indian Ocean and comprising four small islands, Socotra (a governorate of Yemen) is considered one of the most difficult to access and distinct archipelagos in the world. Regarded as the ‚Äújewel‚Äù of biodiversity in the Arabian Sea, the Socotra Archipelago was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Natural site in 2008 because of its high level of endemic species. The long isolation period from continental Arabia (‚âà 20 million years ago), together with its topography and its high ecological and climatic diversity, have given rise to exclusive and spectacular endemic fauna and flora found nowhere else on Earth. Biological field surveys have counted nearly 700 endemic species, including 35% of its 825 plant species and 95% of its more than 100 land snail species.</p>
    <p>Despite the richness and uniqueness of Socotra‚Äôs biodiversity, increasing and insufficiently controlled human activities (e.g. cattle and sheep farming, introduction of exotic species, unsustainable exploitation of resources, and infrastructure and tourism development) pose a serious threat to the long-term conservation of its unique biodiversity.</p>
    <h4>Tool for conservation</h4>
    <p>With few endemic mammal or bird species and no endemic amphibians, reptiles constitute the most relevant vertebrate fauna of Socotra with 31 presently recognized species, 29 of which are endemic (94%). Due to their abundance in Socotra, reptiles constitute a keystone group in the trophic system, both as insect predators and as prey for birds. Moreover, some species have strict associations with specific habitats, as in the case of the endemic gecko Hemidactylus dracaenacolus, which is found only on the endemic Dragon‚Äôs blood tree (Dracaena cynnabari); both species are critically endangered. In this regard, the construction of a DNA-based reference library for all reptiles of the Socotra Archipelago can serve as an integrative tool for monitoring its biodiversity.</p>
