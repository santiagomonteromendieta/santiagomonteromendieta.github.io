    <p>A study led by researchers from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) finds that over 50% of the reptile species in the archipelago of Socotra could still be undiscovered.</p>

    <h4>Astonishing biodiversity</h4>
    <p>Located in the north-west Indian Ocean and comprising four small islands, Socotra (a governorate of Yemen) is considered one of the most difficult to access and distinct archipelagos in the world. Regarded as the ‚Äújewel‚Äù of biodiversity in the Arabian Sea, the Socotra Archipelago was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Natural site in 2008 because of its high level of endemic species. The long isolation period from continental Arabia (‚âà 20 million years ago), together with its topography and its high ecological and climatic diversity, have given rise to exclusive and spectacular endemic fauna and flora found nowhere else on Earth. Biological field surveys have counted nearly 700 endemic species, including 35% of its 825 plant species and 95% of its more than 100 land snail species.</p>
