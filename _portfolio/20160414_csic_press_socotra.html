    <p>A study led by CSIC scientists unveils that over 50% of reptile species in Socotra Archipelago, Yemen, could be unknown. The result comes out from the sequencing of the gene ‚ÄòCOI‚Äô, which is common to all animals. The technique, the so-called DNA barcoding, enables cheap and quick identification of species.</p>
    <p>The Socotra Archipelago, four small islands in the Indian Ocean and nowadays belonging to Yemen, is one of the most difficult to access and distinct archipelagos in the world. Considered the ‚Äòjewel‚Äô of biodiversity in Arabia, the Socotra Archipelago was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Natural site in 2008 because of its high level of endemic species. The long isolation period from continental Arabia (around 20 million years ago) together with its topography and its high ecological and climatic diversity create an exclusive and spectacular endemic fauna and flora found nowhere else on earth.</p>

    <p>Socotra has nearly 700 endemic species, including 35% of its 825 plant species and 95% of its more than 100 land snail species. Of vertebrates, there is only one endemic species of mammal, 6 of birds, and many reptiles. Reptiles are an essential part of the ecosystem, as predators of insects as well as prey for birds. There are 31 species of reptiles, 29 of them endemic. Some species live in very restricted habitats, such as the endemic gecko Hemidactylus dracaenacolus, which only lives on the endemic Dragon‚Äôs blood tree (Dracaena cinnabari). Both are critically endangered species.</p>
    <p>Now, a work led by CSIC scientists and published in the journal PLOS ONE unveils that over 50% of reptile species in Socotra could still be undiscovered. The work is a result of sequencing a small part of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase (COI) in a large number of samples from the Socotra Archipelago.</p>
    <p>Since 2010, the team led by Salvador Carranza, senior researcher at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ibe.upf-csic.es/">Institute of Evolutionary Biology (CSIC-UPF) in Barcelona</a>, has conducted several expeditions to Socotra to collect samples of all known species and localities. For each sample, they have sequenced a small region of the COI gene and then compared it among each other. This gene is shared among all animals, as it is linked to essential life functions and has enough variation to allow discrimination between species.</p>
    <p>This gene, points out Carranza, has a very fast evolution rate. When two populations of animals split up, stopping mating and reproducing, the gene differentiates and evolves quickly, allowing for distinguishing different species.</p>

    <h4>Unexpected Cryptic Diversity</h4>
    <p>Santiago Montero-Mendieta, formerly at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology and now a PhD student at the Estaci√≥n Biol√≥gica de Do√±ana in Sevilla, explains that ‚Äúthe COI gene, similarly to other small genetic markers, can be a cost-effective proxy for specimen identification and species discovery. Nevertheless, he says if it is used alone, it is not the ideal tool for inferring the evolutionary history of species. ‚ÄúWe think that Socotra‚Äôs reptile taxonomy should be revised using an integrative framework, including the use of several genetic markers (mitochondrial and nuclear) as well as ecological and morphological data‚Äù, he says.</p>
    <p>Socotra islands raise questions about species evolution. ‚ÄúIn a small dry non-tropical island like this, we did not expect to find such high genetic diversity. However, we unexpectedly found high levels of cryptic diversity within the reptiles of the Socotra Archipelago‚Äù, says Salvador Carranza.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <h3>‚ÄúIn a small dry non-tropical island like this, we did not expect to find such high genetic diversity"</h3>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As Carranza explains, although many reptile species are morphologically indistinguishable to the human eye, they are actually genetically different. ‚ÄúThis is called ‚Äòcryptic biodiversity‚Äô. Species that we believe are the same, but actually, they are not. It has to be taken into account that apart from the physical aspect, animals have other ways of differentiation, like the smell, which are unnoticed by us‚Äù.</p>
    <p>The work, the first to analyze in detail the reptiles of these islands, claims that up to 54% of Socotra may still be undescribed. ‚ÄúConsidering that currently a third part of Socotran reptiles are threatened, the results of our work could have major implications for species conservation‚Äù, adds Raquel Vasconcelos, a postdoc researcher at CIBIO-InBIO, Portugal.</p>

    <p>Now, experts fear that non-controlled human impact could increase, with the expansion of tourism, the introduction of new exotic species, and resource exploitation, therefore endangering its biodiversity.</p>
    <p>The results of this research will be useful to control reptile biodiversity and to establish priorities for its protection. ‚ÄúOur main goal is to generate a biodiversity atlas for the Socotra reptiles, and to offer with it a useful tool for their quick specimen identification and management‚Äù, says Carranza.</p>

    <h4>DNA Barcoding: Helping to Protect Biodiversity</h4>
    <p>This study is an example of ‚ÄòDNA barcoding‚Äô, a cheap and fast technique to identify different species. In the near future, scientists expect that all known biodiversity on Earth will be inventoried. The ‚ÄòDNA barcoding‚Äô will imply having universal genetic markers - approved by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.barcodeoflife.org/">Barcode of Life international consortium</a> - with which it will be possible to identify any species by analyzing a small sample, such as feathers, skin, blood, or even feces.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <h3>‚ÄòDNA barcoding‚Äô will make it possible to identify any species by analyzing a small sample, such as feathers or feces, without harming the animal</h3>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The technique can help protect biodiversity in different aspects, as it will contribute with evidence and legal tools in doubtful cases. As Carranza explains, in border controls, there are many confiscations of smuggled animals or objects made with skin or fur of protected animals. In non-obvious cases: how can it be proved that the species is legally protected? Carranza also talks about pet shops where animals very similar to endangered species are commercialized. Sometimes, he points out, they could be selling endangered species. He personally received the request of a public agency to analyze animal samples to determine if a shop was selling an endangered amphibian species or not. Once the analysis was done, they could legally impose the sanction.</p>
    <p>A great advantage of ‚ÄòDNA barcoding‚Äô is that it is possible to make an analysis of any kind of sample without harming the animals. It enables identification at any stage of an animal‚Äôs life cycle. ‚ÄúThis means,‚Äù says Salvador Carranza, ‚Äúthat it is possible to identify an amphibian at any of its first stages, such as egg or larva. It is very difficult to differentiate amphibian species at the egg stage. With ‚ÄòDNA barcoding‚Äô, identification can be done with a simple and quick lab test.‚Äù</p>
