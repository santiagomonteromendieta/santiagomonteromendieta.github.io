	<p>Caves are natural laboratories for evolution, offering a glimpse into how life adapts to the most extreme conditions. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.70118" target="_blank">In our new study published in <i>Molecular Ecology</i></a>, we explored the genomic secrets of the small eye golden-line fish (<i>Sinocyclocheilus microphthalmus</i>), a species found only in the subterranean karst systems of Guangxi, China.</p>
	
	<p>This fish is special. At some point in its history, two different species hybridized, and the resulting offspring ended up with a complete "doubled genome" (a state known as allotetraploidy). This rare genetic quirk gave us the perfect opportunity to ask: how does having twice the genetic material help an animal adapt to a world of absolute darkness?</p>

	<h4>Uncovering Hidden Genomic Complexity</h4>
	<p>By sequencing the genomes of 47 fish from six isolated caves, we confirmed they are not a single homogenous population. Instead, each cave harbors its own distinct evolutionary lineage. This geographic separation has allowed them to diverge significantly over time. This is even reflected in their bodies: fish from partially lit caves with more food are robust, while those from deep, nutrient-poor caves are slender with more severely regressed eyes.</p>

	<h4>A Genome with Two Voices</h4>
	<p>The fishâ€™s doubled genome is at the heart of its evolution. It is composed of two "subgenomes" (named 'H' and 'L'), and they are not evolving in lockstep. We consistently found that the H subgenome harbors more genetic variation, providing a rich source of raw material for natural selection to act upon.</p>
