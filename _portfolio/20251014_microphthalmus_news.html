	<p>Caves are natural laboratories for evolution, offering a glimpse into how life adapts to the most extreme conditions. In our new study published in <i>Molecular Ecology</i>, we explored the genomic secrets of the small eye golden-line fish, a species found only in the subterranean karst systems of Guangxi, China.</p>
	
	<p>This fish is special. At some point in its history, two different species hybridized, and the resulting offspring ended up with a complete "doubled genome" (a state known as allotetraploidy). This rare genetic quirk gave us the perfect opportunity to ask: how does having twice the genetic material help an animal adapt to a world of absolute darkness?</p>
