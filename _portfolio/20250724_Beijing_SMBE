	<p>This July was a bit different from my usual routine in Beijing. Instead of my computer work, I joined over a thousand scientists for <b>SMBE 2025</b>. It was a milestone event—the first time this meeting has been held in China—and it felt great to see so many colleagues finally visiting the city where I do my research.</p>

	<p>Between the keynote speeches and the specialized sessions, I spent a lot of time learning from colleagues. The diversity of topics—from population genetics to ancient DNA—was truly inspiring.</p>

    <p>When it was time for the poster sessions, I had the chance to present our work on <span class="highlight">cavefish genomics</span>. It was a busy couple of hours explaining how these animals adapt to extreme environments and receiving some very useful feedback from the audience.</p>

	<p>I also presented a second poster, this time on our <span class="highlight">quail research</span>. It was great to see so much interest from different researchers, and we had some excellent discussions about avian evolution and genomics right there at the board.</p>

	<p>Overall, it was a very rewarding week. Having the "world" of molecular evolution come to my home city was a fantastic experience, and I’m glad to have been a part of this first Chinese SMBE.</p>
