	<p>This July was a bit different from my usual routine in Beijing. Instead of being glued to my computer, I joined over a thousand scientists for the <b>Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution (SMBE) 2025</b> conference. It was a milestone event—the first time this meeting has been held in China—and it felt incredible to welcome so many international colleagues to the city where I do my research.</p>

	<p>Between the keynote speeches and the specialized sessions, I spent a lot of time learning from colleagues. The diversity of topics—from the genetics of ancient humans to the evolution of viruses—was a powerful reminder of how dynamic our field is.</p>

    <h4>Unlocking Adaptation in the Dark</h4>

    <p>During the poster sessions, I had the chance to present our work on the <span class="highlight">genomic evolution of a tetraploid cavefish</span>. The central puzzle we're tackling is how animals adapt to extreme environments. Our cavefish is particularly special because it has a duplicated genome—two copies of every gene—giving it a unique evolutionary toolkit.</p>

    <blockquote>Our research reveals a fascinating strategy: the two genomes evolve asymmetrically. One genome copy is allowed to rapidly change and innovate, discarding useless traits like vision, while the other copy acts as a stable backup, preserving essential life functions. It's evolution's way of having a safety net while taking risks.</blockquote>

    <h4>An Evolutionary Puzzle in Plain Sight</h4>
	
	<p>I also presented a second poster on our <span class="highlight">Common Quail research</span>, which tackles a completely different kind of evolutionary mystery. Quails are highly migratory, so we'd expect their genes to be well-mixed. But they're not. We see physically distinct birds in the same regions, which led us to uncover massive 'supergenes'—huge chunks of flipped chromosomes called inversions—that drive these differences.</p>

    <blockquote>The big surprise was discovering two different inversion systems with completely different 'fates'. One is a young, 'local' supergene that creates the darker, heavier birds in a specific region. But the other is an ancient, widespread 'engine' that generates hidden genetic diversity across the entire species and is evolving incredibly rapidly.</blockquote>

	<p>Overall, it was a rewarding and inspiring week. Having the world of molecular evolution come to my home city was a fantastic experience, and I’m proud to have shared our stories of discovery at this historic first SMBE in China.</p>
