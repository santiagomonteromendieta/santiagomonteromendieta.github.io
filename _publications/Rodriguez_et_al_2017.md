excerpt: Due to extreme morphological similarities some species remain undetected to the eyes of taxonomists and when discovered, often by the application of more refined techniques or increased sampling effort, are termed cryptic species. Among animals, such taxonomic discoveries are more frequent in nocturnal taxa, like arthropods and amphibians, which often rely on chemical or acoustic cues for communication and provide scarce information to our visually-oriented brain (Bickford, et al., 2006). The definition of a species as cryptic is to certain degree subjective, i.e., subtle morphological differences might be obvious to specialists but remain undetected by untrained observers. Yet, there is little doubt that a large number of truly cryptic species exist, and amphibians are an animal group where this phenomenon has become obvious in the past decades ...

We studied the variation in genetics, bioacustics, and morphology in Eleutherodactylus glamyrus, a regionally endemic frog species restricted to high elevations in the Sierra Maestra Massif, Western Cuba that was originally described as a cryptic species hidden under the name E. auriculatus. Genetic analysis of mtDNA sequences of the 16S and cob genes identify two allopatric and strongly supported mitochondrial clades (phylogroups) which also showed no haplotype shar- ing in the nuclear Rag-1 gene. Bioacustic, and morphological comparisons concordantly identify these two phylogroups as independent evolutionary lineages. Therefore, we herein restrict the name Eleutherodactylus glamyrus Estrada and Hedges to populations represented in our analyses as the western phylogroup (Cordillera del Turquino to Pico La Bayame- sa) and consider specimens from the eastern phylogroup (Sierra del Cobre) to represent a new species described and named as Eleutherodactylus cattus. Our results add to the growing list of Eleutherodactylus species endemic to Cuba and highlight the importance of combining different sources of evidence for obtaining robust assessments of species limits in amphibians.
