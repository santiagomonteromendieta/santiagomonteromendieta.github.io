Mountain ranges offer opportunities for understanding how species evolved and diversified across different environmental conditions. Neotropical frogs of the genus Oreobates (Anura: Craugastoridae) are adapted to highland and lowland habitats along the Andes, but many aspects of their evolution remain unknown. We studied their evolutionary history using ~18,000 exons enriched by targeted sequence-capture. Since capture success was very variable across samples, we evaluated to what degree differing data filtering produced robust inferences. The inferred evolutionary framework evidenced phylogenetic discordances among lowland species that can be explained by taxonomic misidentification or admixture of ancestral lineages. Highland species showed smaller effective populations than lowland frogs, probably due to greater habitat fragmentation in montane environments. Stronger genetic drift likely decreased the power of purifying selection and led to an increased proportion of nonsynonymous mutations in highland populations that could play an important role in their adaptation. Overall, our work sheds light on the evolutionary history and diversification of this group of Neotropical frogs along elevational gradients in the Andes as well as on their patterns of intraspecific diversity.
